# PC Part E-commerce website with Commerce.js

This was a project where I wanted to leverage using a headless e-commerce solution since for now I am only a front-end developer. I read online that commerce.js is useful for such a situation since you can do almost the whole flow of e-commerce with just the API. Unfortunately that codebase isn't being actively worked on anymore which does lead to some delays but it was still a good learning experience for me since I was able to fetch the products for the app and do filter operations too.

The nice thing about this approach is the fact that the app technically could be used by anyone else who has a shop on using commerce.js with just a swap of the API key and assets.

Though a custom solution would undoubtedly be better for more serious endeavors, this still proved to be a good learning experience.
